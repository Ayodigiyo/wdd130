  <img src="images/nigeria-flag.webp" alt="Flag of Nigeria" loading="rich">
  <p>"Nigeria is a vibrant and dynamic West African nation celebrated for its extraordinary cultural diversity, with over 250 ethnic groups and 500 languages. As Africa’s most populous country and largest economy, Nigeria is a hub of innovation, especially in Lagos—the bustling commercial capital often dubbed “Silicon Lagoon” for its thriving tech startup ecosystem. The country boasts stunning natural landscapes, from the golden beaches of Calabar and Lekki to the sweeping savannas of the north and the lush rainforests of the Niger Delta. Rich in history, Nigeria is home to ancient kingdoms, world-renowned Nollywood films, and globally influential music like Afrobeats. Its people are known for their resilience, entrepreneurial spirit, and warm hospitality. Whether through its flavorful cuisine, colorful festivals, or dynamic arts scene, Nigeria continues to leave a powerful mark on global culture and commerce—all while navigating the challenges and opportunities of rapid urbanization and economic "transformation".</p>
